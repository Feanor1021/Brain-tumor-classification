# Brain Tumor Classification

This is a project for classifying brain tumors into four categories: no tumor, glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, and pituitary tumor. The dataset used in this project is the Brain Tumor Classification dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

The project uses logistic regression to classify brain tumors into four categories. The dataset is preprocessed to remove any missing or incomplete data and to normalize the feature values. The logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated using cross-validation.

## Usage

### Dataset

The Brain Tumor Classification dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. The dataset contains over 2800 images of brain tumors, divided into four categories: no tumor, glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, and pituitary tumor.

### Software Setup

To run this project, you will need to install the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- opencv-python

You can install these packages using pip:

    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib opencv-python
    
### Usage

Once you have installed the required packages, you can run the `brain_tumor_classification.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data, train and evaluate the logistic regression model on the Brain Tumor Classification dataset.

The notebook contains detailed explanations of the code and the process of building the model. Additionally, it contains visualizations of the data and the model's performance.
